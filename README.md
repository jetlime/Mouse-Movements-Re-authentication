# User authentication based on Mouse Movements  
This project presents a solution to authentify users based on their mouse movements with the design of a 
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) classifier that is able to differentiate imposters from the actual user. 
In the report of the BSP, we defined and reported the results obtained in the different empirical experiments. In order to make our research reproducable and verifiable, we published the code to train and evaluate the models for every experiment.
